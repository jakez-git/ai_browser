# Design: Open WebUI Agent Platform Enhancements

## Architecture Overview
The solution consists of modular components enabling agent orchestration, browser isolation, secure file access, and branding customization.

## Component Descriptions
- **Delegation Controller**: Manages agent task queues, pipe invocations, and subtask lifecycle.
- **Pipe Function Registry**: Catalog of actionable functions enabling agent-to-agent delegation and workflow composition.
- **Agent Workers**: Individual agent instances, each with model configuration and task-specific context isolation.
- **Browser Extension**: Interface layer providing tab grouping, UI enhancements, and action buttons via the Action Functions API.
- **Tab Group Manager**: Coordinates browser tab grouping to maintain separate execution contexts per agent or workflow.
- **Context Isolation Service**: Ensures data boundaries between tab groups and orchestrates cleanup on task completion.
- **File Access Plugin**: Mediates local file IO requests from agents through sandboxed interfaces.
- **Permission Sandbox**: Enforces least-privilege access, explicit user approval, and revocation flows.
- **Audit Logger**: Captures traceable records of all file operations and delegation actions.
- **Theme Engine**: Applies branding packages across UI surfaces, supporting multi-tenant SaaS customizations.
- **Brand Assets**: Structured storage for logos, colors, typography, and legal content.
- **Distribution Config**: Build-time and runtime toggles for packaging, deployment, and white-label options.

## Data Flows
1. Delegation requests originate from the main agent, triggering pipe functions that spawn subtasks via the Delegation Controller.
2. Browser UI communicates with the Delegation Controller to present interactive buttons and status indicators through Action Functions.
3. Tab Group Manager groups browser tabs per workflow, leveraging extension APIs to maintain isolation and cleanup.
4. File Access Plugin receives sandboxed requests, verifies permissions within the Permission Sandbox, executes operations, and writes audit logs.
5. Theme Engine applies configuration-specified branding assets across UI components, ensuring consistent presentation.

## Technology Considerations
- **Agent Runtime**: Extend Open WebUI plugin system to register delegation pipes and worker pools.
- **Browser Extension**: Target Chromium extension APIs first; assess Firefox compatibility during feasibility study.
- **File Access**: Use OS-native sandboxing mechanisms where possible (e.g., File System Access API) with additional application-level guards.
- **Branding**: Implement theming via CSS variables and modular asset packages.

## Deployment Model
- Core application packaged as containerized service with plugin registration.
- Browser extension distributed via Chrome Web Store (initially) with staged rollout to other browsers.
- File access plugin configurable per deployment, with environment-specific permission manifests.
