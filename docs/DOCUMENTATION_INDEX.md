> **Documentation Priorities**
> 1. Maximize LLM understanding
> 2. Maximize LLM strengths (pattern recognition, consistency, exhaustive reasoning)
> 3. Minimize LLM weaknesses (ambiguity, hidden context, state drift)
> 4. Optimize for LLM context efficiency
> 5. Human readability is secondary

- `docs/backlog.md` *(legacy brainstorm to be migrated as needed)*
- `docs/notes.md`, `docs/llm_log.md`, `docs/llm_prefs.md` *(to be created when historical context is captured)*

## Subdirectories
- `docs/requirements/` â€“ Requirement packs for subprojects (each must restate documentation priorities).
