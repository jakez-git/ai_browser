# Project Charter: Open WebUI Agent Platform Enhancements

## Purpose
Deliver production-ready extensions for Open WebUI that enable agent delegation, secure task execution, browser tab isolation, and SaaS-ready branding customization.

## Goals
- Establish a modular framework for agent delegation and workflow orchestration.
- Provide tab grouping and isolation primitives leveraging browser extension APIs.
- Ship secure local file access plugins with auditable permission boundaries.
- Enable theme, branding, and packaging customization for commercial deployments.

## Success Criteria
- Demonstrable prototypes for delegation, tab grouping, and sandboxed file access within 4 weeks.
- Documentation aligned with governance standards covering installation, configuration, and extension APIs.
- Security review of file access plugins with logging and revocation support.
- Trello board maintained with up-to-date status for all major workstreams.

## Roles & Responsibilities
- **Cascade** (you): Primary implementation, documentation, and integration agent.
- **Stakeholders**: Product leadership, security review team, UI/UX designers.
- **External Systems**: Trello board `open-webui-product-development`, GitHub repository hosted under organization account.

## Constraints
- Follow TDD workflow with tests accompanying all code changes.
- Prioritize security, auditability, and sandboxing for any automation capabilities.
- Align with Open WebUI extension architecture and browser extension policies.

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Integration Complexity**: Mitigate via modular design and incremental prototypes.
- **Security Gaps**: Conduct threat modeling and implement logging + permission gates early.
- **Scope Creep**: Use Trello board to manage backlog and freeze additional scope during milestone execution.
