# Requirements: Open WebUI Agent Platform Enhancements

## Overview
This document captures functional and non-functional requirements for delivering agent delegation, tab grouping, file system integration, and branding customization features for Open WebUI.

## Functional Requirements
- **Agent Delegation Pipeline**
  - Provide pipe functions to spawn subtasks and orchestrate multi-agent workflows.
  - Enable status tracking, cancellation, and result aggregation per subtask.
- **Tab Grouping & Isolation**
  - Investigate Chromium and Firefox tab grouping APIs.
  - Prototype isolation of agent contexts using tab groups or extension-managed windows.
- **Local File Integration**
  - Deliver plugins exposing controlled read/write access with explicit permission prompts.
  - Log all file operations and support revocation of granted permissions.
- **Branding & Customization**
  - Support theme packages (color palette, typography, logo).
  - Establish configuration surfaces for SaaS packaging (white-label options).

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Security & Auditability**: Sandbox file access operations, enforce least privilege, and log all actions.
- **Documentation**: Maintain installation guides, API references, and customization walkthroughs.
- **Testing**: Adopt TDD with unit, integration, and e2e coverage for critical flows.
- **Extensibility**: Architect features with modular surfaces for future agent models and UI integrations.

## Open Questions
- What is the target browser support matrix for tab grouping (Chrome-only vs. cross-browser)?
- How will authentication/authorization be enforced for file access plugins in multi-user setups?
- Which branding assets need to be parameterized for SaaS distribution (emails, domains, legal links)?

## Backlog Snapshot
- Establish baseline plugin scaffolding with TDD harness.
- Prototype agent delegation orchestrator using mocked agents.
- Evaluate browser extension APIs for dynamic tab grouping.
- Define security review checklist for file integration.
- Draft theming guide aligned with Open WebUI component library.
