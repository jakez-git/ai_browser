# Requirements: Local Chat UI with Live Knowledge Base

## Overview
This document captures functional and non-functional requirements for delivering a local-first chat interface backed by a continuously updating knowledge base sourced from a watched directory tree.

## Functional Requirements
- **Chat UI**
  - Provide a responsive web UI for conversing with a local/free LLM.
  - Support conversation history, context resets, and export of chat transcripts.
- **Knowledge Base Ingestion**
  - Recursively index a designated root folder (files and subfolders) with configurable filters.
  - Detect filesystem changes (create/update/delete) and refresh embeddings immediately without downtime.
  - Handle large text transcripts and binary media by invoking transcription pipelines when available.
- **Retrieval & Reasoning**
  - Implement retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) or superior alternative to ground LLM responses in indexed content.
  - Surface citations linking responses to source files and timestamps.
- **Content Management**
  - Expose dashboards or logs summarizing ingestion status, errors, and recent updates.
  - Provide manual reindex triggers and safe shutdown routines.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Local-First Operation**: Run entirely on local hardware (Intel i9-12900, 64 GB RAM, RTX 3060) or free services.
- **Low Latency Updates**: Target sub-minute propagation from file change to retrievable content.
- **Observability**: Provide metrics/logs for ingestion latency, model inference, and storage utilization.
- **Privacy**: Ensure no data leaves the local environment without explicit configuration.
- **Maintainability**: Modularize components (UI, ingestion, embeddings, storage) for TDD coverage and swapping models.

## Open Questions
- Which LLM(s) will be used initially (e.g., GGUF models via llama.cpp, LoRA fine-tunes, or remote free APIs)?
- Which embedding model balances accuracy with GPU/CPU performance for large transcript corpora?
- How will video ingestion be handled (pre-existing transcripts vs. automated transcription tooling)?
- Do we require user authentication for the chat UI within a local network environment?

## Backlog Snapshot
- Evaluate local LLM runtimes (llama.cpp, text-generation-webui, vLLM) for chat responsiveness.
- Implement filesystem watcher service with debounce and batching controls.
- Build ingestion pipeline with chunking, metadata extraction, and embedding storage.
- Create retrieval service exposing query API with streaming citations.
- Prototype chat frontend with conversation management and retrieval display.
- Integrate optional transcription workflow for video/audio files.
