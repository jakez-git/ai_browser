> **Documentation Priorities**
> 1. Maximize LLM understanding

> 4. Optimize for LLM context efficiency
> 5. Human readability is secondary

# Roadmap: Local Chat UI with Live Knowledge Base

## Phase 1: Foundations (Week 1)
- Establish local development environment (Python backend + frontend tooling).
- Select initial local/free LLM runtime and embedding model.
- Define directory structure and configuration for watched knowledge base.

## Phase 2: Ingestion Pipeline (Week 2)
- Implement filesystem watcher service with debounce and batching.
- Build ingestion orchestrator, chunking, and metadata extraction pipeline.
- Persist embeddings and documents to local vector store/database.

## Phase 3: Retrieval & Chat UI (Week 3)
- Implement retrieval service with citation support.
- Integrate chat UI with streaming responses from local LLM.
- Display retrieval snippets, metadata, and indexing status indicators.

## Phase 4: Media & Transcription Support (Week 4)
- Integrate local transcription pipeline (e.g., Whisper.cpp/faster-whisper) for audio/video ingestion.
- Handle large transcript ingestion and chunking optimizations.
- Provide operator controls for manual reindexing and error recovery.

## Phase 5: Hardening & Extensions (Week 5)
- Optimize model performance, caching, and batching strategies.
- Add observability dashboards (ingestion latency, storage usage, error logs).
- Evaluate alternative knowledge integration strategies and document findings.

## Continuous Activities
- Track progress via repository artifacts (`docs/backlog.md`, status logs) and commit history.
- Follow TDD workflow with tests for every feature increment.
- Update documentation (`docs/`) and audit logs after each milestone.
- Conduct regular security, privacy, and UX reviews before advancing phases.
